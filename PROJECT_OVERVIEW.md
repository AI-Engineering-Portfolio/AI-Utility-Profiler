# AI Engineering Portfolio – Project A: AI Utility Profiler

This project is part of a 7-flagship AI Engineering Portfolio designed to demonstrate enterprise-grade AI/ML engineering capabilities, including data ingestion, profiling, modeling, deployment, and operationalization.

## Purpose
To showcase a production-ready AI pattern for:
- Automated data profiling  
- Anomaly detection  
- Data quality scoring  
- ML-based insight generation  

## Enterprise Relevance
Utility companies deal with complex datasets that must be validated, cleansed, and profiled before use.  
This project provides a reusable AI component that can plug into real utility workflows and generate dashboard-ready metrics.

## Reusability
This project shares reusable elements with all other portfolio projects:
- Standard folder layout  
- YAML config patterns  
- GitHub repo structure  
- Testing and deployment workflows  
- Documentation templates  

## Links
The main AI Engineering Portfolio will reference this project as "Project A".
